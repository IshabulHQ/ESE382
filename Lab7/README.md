Laboratory 7: Simple Sequential Circuits
Objective: Write design descriptions for four simple sequential circuits. The last sequential circuit is combined with a combinational circuit to create a simple structural system.

Design Task 1: Latch versus Flip-flop
Design Task 2: D flip-flop with Enable Input
Design Task 3: Mesmerizer

	A sequential system that drives a single horizontal array of seven LEDs. This array is driven by a vector named 
	led_array. An array element that is 1 turns ON its associated LED. A 0 turns OFF its associated LED. 
	Create a continually repeating sequence of patterns on the LED array. The sequence of patterns, 
	represented by the led_array values needed to control the LEDs, is:
	1000001
	0100010
	0010100
	0001000
	0010100
	0100010
	1000001
