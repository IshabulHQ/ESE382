# ESE382
Lab work done in VHDL done for class ESE 382: Digital Design Using VHDL and PLDs

Digital system design using the hardware description language VHDL and system implementation using complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs) and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). Topics include design methodology, VHDL syntax, entities, architectures, testbenches, subprograms, packages, and libraries. Architecture and characteristics of PLDs and FPGAs are studied. Laboratory work involves writing the VHDL descriptions and testbenches for designs, compiling, and functionally stimulating the designs, fitting and timing simulation of the fitted designs, and programming the designs into a CPLD or FPGA and bench testing.
