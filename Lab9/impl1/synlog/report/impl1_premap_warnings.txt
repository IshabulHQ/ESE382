@W: MT529 :"c:\my_designs\lab 8\lab8\task1\src\send_pos_edge_det.vhd":39:3:39:4|Found inferred clock SPI_test_system_I|clk which controls 7 sequential elements including u0.present_state[1]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
